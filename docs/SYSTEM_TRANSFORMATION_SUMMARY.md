## ðŸ”‘ Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. **Why Community Feed?**
- Help users discover disposal locations from real experiences
- Build a supportive community around e-waste management
- Increase engagement through social features
- Share best practices and success stories

### 2. **Why Dispose/Repurpose Instead of Recycle?**
- More accurate terminology for e-waste management
- "Dispose" = proper removal/destruction
- "Repurpose" = giving items new life/donating
- "Recycle" is too narrow for electronics

### 3. **Why Public Submissions?**
- Transparency helps others find disposal centers
- Community learns from each other's experiences
- Gamification through likes/comments increases participation
- Location sharing benefits everyone

1. **Update Supabase Schema**
   - Rename `recycling_history` â†’ `disposal_history`
   - Add community post fields (is_public, description, likes, comments)

2. **Implement Backend Integration**
   - Connect community feed to real Supabase data
   - Add likes/comments functionality
   - Implement post creation from submissions

3. **Rename Remaining Files**
   - Update file names with "recycle" â†’ "dispose"
   - Update model class names
   - Update service method names

4. **Add Social Features**
   - Comments screen
   - Notifications for likes/comments
   - User profiles showing their posts
   - Share functionality

5. **Testing**
   - Test community feed with real data
   - Test submission â†’ post creation flow
   - Test social interactions (like, comment, share)
